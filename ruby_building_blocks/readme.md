## Ruby Building Blocks

#### Project1: Caesar Cipher
Implement a caesar cipher that takes in a string and the shift factor and then outputs the modified string
Wikepida: [Caesar Cipher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)
Wikepida: [rot13](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) , rotate by 13 is an example of a caesar cipher.


####Project2: Stock Picker
Implement a method `#stock_picker` that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0.

#### Project3: Substrings
Implement a method `#substrings` that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.
