## RestClient Warmup Project

Simple script to practice submitting HTTP requests from the command line 
(IRB actually) and also to play around with a new gem called `rest-client`. 

**Objective:** Use RestClient to do a Google search and examine the results
(you can find the parameters that Google wants in the URL by simply making a 
search in a normal browser).
